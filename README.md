# Robotic-arm-5DOF-design
A 3D model of a robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom, created using Tinkercad to demonstrate jointed movement and structural design

### Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
The robotic arm is designed with 5 degrees of freedom, providing flexibility and precise control over movement. Each DOF represents an independent motion, as described below:
1. Base rotation – Rotates the entire arm left and right.  
2. First joint (lower arm) – Moves the arm up and down.  
3. Second joint (upper arm) – Allows further extension or bending.  
4. Third joint (near gripper) – Controls the angle of the end segment.  
5. Gripper – Opens and closes to grab or release objects.
